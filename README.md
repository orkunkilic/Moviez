In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the electron app in development mode.<br />

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React and electron in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
